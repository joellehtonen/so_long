possible leak if player clicks on x in window

do textures need to be static?

make a separate function for allocating memory

make sure that dog cannot die by hitting edge walls (only inner ones)

with make, mlx42 rebuilds every time

chicken and enemy images clash each time a chicken is collected

put bonus to different files??? (maybe just enemy stuff)

MLX_TERMINATE segfaults for some reason

fix idle animation

remove unnecessary variables from structs

should one newline at the end of the map be accepted
