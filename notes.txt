could the game crash if move_count goes above int_max?

add limit that the map doesnt expand too much (more than screen size)

DONE checker to check if input characters are valid (maybe during inputting graphics)

move_count updates but doesnt display if pressing 2 keys and hitting wall in one direction

refactor x and y coordinates of player (since its now stored in a struct)

add different walls and way to randomize between them

make different error messages

DONE enemy needs alternative moves in case of a collision

possible leak if player clicks on x in window

DONE enemy "dies" if it hits wall?

add a check in case image loading fails

DONE make a program that flips the images when left was the last key that was pressed

do textures need to be static?

make a separate function for allocating memory

make sure that dog cannot die by hitting edge walls (only inner ones)

with make, mlx42 rebuilds every time

only approve if map ends with .ber\0 (add function for this check)

use memset to init all variables to 0

check min size and max size for map

FIX FT_REALLOC

add reverse death animation for dog

map minimum height 3

remove boolean

chicken and enemy images clash each time a chicken is collected
