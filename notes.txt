DONE flood fill to check if map is invalid (if you can reach exit and all the collectibles)

reset button to reset the game?

could the game crash if move_count goes above int_max?

after checking the map, blow it out by multiplying it by 32. 
that way you can move smoothly with +- 5 increments
- add limit that the map doesnt expand too much (more than screen size)

probably no need for player_box. just x and y coordinates and add TILE_SIZE to get the other side
maybe remove ghost box too? or at least TILE_SIZE from it
