could the game crash if move_count goes above int_max?

add limit that the map doesnt expand too much (more than screen size)

move_count updates but doesnt display if pressing 2 keys and hitting wall in one direction

refactor x and y coordinates of player (since its now stored in a struct)

possible leak if player clicks on x in window

add a check in case image loading fails

do textures need to be static?

make a separate function for allocating memory

make sure that dog cannot die by hitting edge walls (only inner ones)

with make, mlx42 rebuilds every time

only approve if map ends with .ber\0 (add function for this check)

use memset to init all variables to 0

check min size and max size for map

FIX FT_REALLOC

remove boolean

chicken and enemy images clash each time a chicken is collected

replace error numbers with messages defined in h

put bonus to different files??? (maybe just enemy stuff)

MLX_TERMINATE segfaults for some reason

fix idle animation

remove unnecessary variables from structs
