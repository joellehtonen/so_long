reset button to reset the game?

could the game crash if move_count goes above int_max?

add limit that the map doesnt expand too much (more than screen size)

checker to check if input characters are valid

move_count updates but doesnt display if pressing 2 keys and hitting wall in one direction

refactor x and y coordinates of player (since its now stored in a struct)

add different walls and way to randomize between them

make different error messages

enemy needs alternative moves in case of a collision

possible leak if player clicks on x in window

enemy "dies" if it hits wall?

add a check in case image loading fails

make a program that flips the images when left was the last key that was pressed

do textures need to be static?

make a separate function for allocating memory

make sure that dog cannot die by hitting edge walls (only inner ones)
